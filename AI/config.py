# Local configuration file for development.
# This file should NOT contain secrets committed to git. Put real secrets in
# environment variables (preferred) or create a local `config.py` which is
# excluded from version control.

# Example (do not commit real credentials):
# MONGO_URI = "your-mongo-uri-here"
# GROQ_API_KEY = "your-groq-api-key-here"
# DATABASE_NAME = "your_database_name"
